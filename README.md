# C#-Unity-Scripts-

Scripts written in C# for Unity that can be used for a game.
The scripts are written by me but they can be used for fan projects or even commercial use.
The scripts are designed for Platformers/Endless runners, but can be re-qritten for other genres.

For this project simple square objects were made as assets for the scripts.

The Enemy Movement Script is Designed to always move towards where the Player Square(Blue).
Once the Player is hit, the Health Bar will be showcasing how much Health has been taken.

The number/percentage taken can all be customized from inside the Unity Hub.
You first select the script from the Top left corner.

And lastly change the values from the Right corner to fit the requirments for your game.

Hope this helps with a startup in learning C# for Unity.
